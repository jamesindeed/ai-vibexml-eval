Deployment Strategy Concerns:\n   - The current rolling update strategy (25% max unavailable, 25% max surge) might be too aggressive\n   - Potential resolution:\n     ```yaml\n     strategy:\n       type: RollingUpdate\n       rollingUpdate:\n         maxUnavailable: 10%\n         maxSurge: 20%\n     ```\n   - Rationale: Less aggressive scaling reduces simultaneous pod disruption\n\n2. Resource Allocation Issues:\n   - Modest resource requests/limits might cause pod scheduling and startup failures\n   - Recommended configuration:\n     ```yaml\n     resources:\n       requests:\n         cpu: 200m\n         memory: 512Mi\n       limits:\n         cpu: 750m\n         memory: 1Gi\n     ```\n   - Rationale: Increased resources prevent potential out-of-memory scenarios\n\n3. Liveness Probe Configuration:\n   - Current probe might be too restrictive\n   - Suggested improvements:\n     ```yaml\n     livenessProbe:\n       httpGet:\n         path: /health\n         port: 8080\n       initialDelaySeconds: 45\n       periodSeconds: 10\n       failureThreshold: 3\n       timeoutSeconds: 5\n     ```\n   - Rationale: Longer initial delay, more lenient failure threshold\n\n4. Secret and Environment Configuration:\n   - Verify that `db-secret` exists in the same namespace\n   - Consider using environment-specific configuration\n\n5. Additional Recommendations:\n   - Add readiness probe to complement liveness probe\n   - Implement horizontal pod autoscaler for better resource management\n   - Use consistent image tagging strategy\n\nSpecific Root Cause Analysis:\n- \"Pods failing to start\": Likely due to insufficient resources or misconfigured probes\n- \"Memory usage spiking\": Indicates potential memory leak or inadequate resource allocation\n- \"Health checks timing out\": Suggests network or application responsiveness issues\n\nComprehensive Resolution Strategy:\n1. Adjust resource allocations\n2. Optimize deployment strategy\n3. Enhance probe configurations\n4. Implement proper monitoring and logging\n\nThe recommended changes should significantly improve deployment stability, resource utilization, and overall application performance.",
